If downloading a few small datasets you can copy and paste the links directly into your web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
This will not work for any data over 5 GB. You can check the entry in Scicat to see the data size.

If you have mulitple links and large datasets please select the instructions relevant to your operating system:

e.g.
cd my_data_dir
Then download the data using
wget -i /path/to/data_file.txt

Mac OS
Open a terminal session. Navigate to the the directory where you want the data to reside:
e.g.
cd my_data_dir
Then download the data from file using:
i=0; cat /path/to/data_file.txt | while read f; do echo curl "${f}" -O; done;

Windows

You will only need to do the following once:
If you do not have a python distribution you will need to download one from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/.

Then go to command prompt and run the following command:
python -m pip install wget.

Now you are ready to download your files:
Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to save the data:
e.g. cd my_data_dir
Once you are there run the following:
import wget
import sys

def download_urls(url_file):
    with open(url_file, 'r') as f:
        urls = f.readlines()
    print(urls)
    for url in urls:
        wget.download(url)
